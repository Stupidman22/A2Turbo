A2Turbo	
=============

Android+Arduino Turbocharger controller.

This project is a Eletronic Fuel Injection (EFI) for my supercharged car.

It's a supercharger monitor (turbo pressure, combustion sensor, g-force, temperature,...) sensored by Arduino hardware.
Android phone is used to show these data and mapping fuel injection.
